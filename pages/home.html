            Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things To low ambition, and the
            pride of kings. Let us (since life can little more supply Than just
            to look about us and to die) Expatiate free o'er all this scene of
            man; A mighty maze! but not without a plan; A wild, where weeds and
            flow'rs promiscuous shoot; Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
            Together let us beat this ample field, Try what the open, what the
            covert yield; The latent tracts, the giddy heights explore Of all
            who blindly creep, or sightless soar; Eye Nature's walks, shoot
            folly as it flies, And catch the manners living as they rise; Laugh
            where we must, be candid where we can; But vindicate the ways of God
            to man. I. Say first, of God above, or man below, What can we
            reason, but from what we know? Of man what see we, but his station
            here, From which to reason, or to which refer? Through worlds
            unnumber'd though the God be known, 'Tis ours to trace him only in
            our own. He, who through vast immensity can pierce, See worlds on
            worlds compose one universe, Observe how system into system runs,
            What other planets circle other suns, What varied being peoples
            ev'ry star, May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are. But of this
            frame the bearings, and the ties, The strong connections, nice
            dependencies, Gradations just, has thy pervading soul Look'd
            through? or can a part contain the whole? Is the great chain, that
            draws all to agree, And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee? II.
            Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou find, Why form'd so weak,
            so little, and so blind? First, if thou canst, the harder reason
            guess, Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less! Ask of thy mother
            earth, why oaks are made Taller or stronger than the weeds they
            shade? Or ask of yonder argent fields above, Why Jove's satellites
            are less than Jove? Of systems possible, if 'tis confest That Wisdom
            infinite must form the best, Where all must full or not coherent be,
            And all that rises, rise in due degree; Then, in the scale of
            reas'ning life, 'tis plain There must be somewhere, such a rank as
            man: And all the question (wrangle e'er so long) Is only this, if
            God has plac'd him wrong? Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,
            May, must be right, as relative to all. In human works, though
            labour'd on with pain, A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;
            In God's, one single can its end produce; Yet serves to second too
            some other use. So man, who here seems principal alone, Perhaps acts
            second to some sphere unknown, Touches some wheel, or verges to some
            goal; 'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole. When the proud steed
            shall know why man restrains His fiery course, or drives him o'er
            the plains: When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod, Is now a
            victim, and now Egypt's God: Then shall man's pride and dulness
            comprehend His actions', passions', being's, use and end; Why doing,
            suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why This hour a slave, the next a
            deity. Then say not man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault; Say rather,
            man's as perfect as he ought: His knowledge measur'd to his state
            and place, His time a moment, and a point his space. If to be
            perfect in a certain sphere, What matter, soon or late, or here or
            there? The blest today is as completely so, As who began a thousand
            years ago. III. Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate,
            All but the page prescrib'd, their present state: From brutes what
            men, from men what spirits know: Or who could suffer being here
            below? The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today, Had he thy reason,
            would he skip and play? Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry
            food, And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood. Oh blindness
            to the future! kindly giv'n, That each may fill the circle mark'd by
            Heav'n: Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, A hero perish, or a
            sparrow fall, Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd, And now a bubble
            burst, and now a world. Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things
            To low ambition, and the pride of kings. Let us (since life can
            little more supply Than just to look about us and to die) Expatiate
